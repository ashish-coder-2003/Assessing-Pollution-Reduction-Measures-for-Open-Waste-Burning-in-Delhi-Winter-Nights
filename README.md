# Assessing-Pollution-Reduction-Measures-for-Open-Waste-Burning-in-Delhi-Winter-Nights
Project Overview
This project, conducted during my internship at the Council on Energy, Environment, and Water (CEEW), focuses on evaluating the environmental impact of open waste burning in Delhiâ€™s winter nights. The study aims to analyze fire incidents, assess the contribution of open burning to air pollution, and propose data-driven interventions for pollution reduction.

Objective
The primary goal is to quantify the effect of night-time open waste burning on air quality and explore potential solutions to mitigate its impact.

Key Tasks & Methodology
1. Data Collection & Cleaning
Collected fire incident reports from Vasant Kunj and nearby areas to identify burning hotspots.
Acquired air quality data (AQI, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, Black Carbon) for analysis.
Performed data cleaning, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and structuring the dataset for analysis.
2. Data Analysis & Visualization
Processed 500+ air quality data points to detect pollution trends before and after fire incidents.
Conducted correlation analysis using Python (pandas, matplotlib) to quantify the impact of waste burning on air quality.
Developed Google Maps-based data visualizations to identify pollution hotspots.
Created interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize pollution trends and track intervention effectiveness.
3. Findings & Insights
Identified a 65% increase in PM2.5 levels on nights with reported waste burning incidents.
Demonstrated a 67.5% reduction in fire incidents after implementing awareness campaigns and local enforcement measures.
Suggested policy interventions, including stricter waste management rules and night patrols, which could reduce pollution spikes by 30-40%.

Tools & Technologies Used
Data Analysis: Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn), SQL
Visualization & Reporting: Power BI, Google Maps API, Excel
Dashboard Development: Power BI, DAX
Geospatial Analysis: Google Maps API, GIS-based mapping

Outcome & Impact
Provided actionable insights to policymakers, environmental organizations, and local authorities.
Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to monitor pollution trends in real-time.
Contributed to developing strategies that could significantly reduce pollution caused by open waste burning.
